# TestingAuth

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installing the node_modules in the project directory

### `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom`

This module is distributed via npm which is bundled with node and should be installed as one of your project's devDependencies

### `Installing jest:`

When you create a new React application using create-react-app, jest comes with it so you do not have to do anything to install jest. 

### 'npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer`

Install react-test-renderer as well as add it as dev dependency in package.json file.

### 'npm install --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer`
